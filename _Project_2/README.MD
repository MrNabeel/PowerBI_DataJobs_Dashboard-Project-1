# 📊 Data Jobs Salary by Skills & Country Dashboard – Power BI

**Project 2 | Continuing my Data Jobs Analysis Series**

> *A deep-dive visualization into how specific technical skills, job titles, and countries influence salary trends across the global data job market.*

---

## 🌍 Overview

Building upon my first Data Jobs Dashboard, this project focuses on **how skills shape salary outcomes** in the 2024 global data industry.  
The dashboard connects **skills proficiency, regional trends, and job titles** to uncover where opportunities in data analytics, engineering, and science truly pay off.

The goal was to move from **“what’s happening”** in the job market to **“why it’s happening”** — blending storytelling and data intelligence.
