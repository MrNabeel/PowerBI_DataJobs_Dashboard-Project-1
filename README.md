# 👋 Welcome to My Data Analytics Portfolio

**Muhammad Nabeel | Business Analytics Student**

Hi there! Thanks for stopping by my portfolio.  
I’m passionate about transforming data into meaningful stories that drive smarter decisions.  
Through my journey in Business Analytics, I’ve been exploring tools like **Power BI, DAX, Power Query, and ETL workflows**, and diving deeper into how **AI and automation** are reshaping analytics.

This repository serves as a growing collection of my analytical projects — starting with my latest Power BI work on **Global Data Jobs Analysis (2024)** and continuing into my learning journey with **AI-powered data storytelling**.
